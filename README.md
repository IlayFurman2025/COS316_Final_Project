# COS316 Final Project: Privacy Plus Adblock

## By Illay Furman and Carl Zielinski, Fall 2023


**Privacy Plus Adblock - Enhance Your Privacy and Browsing Experience!**

Please see the included paper for full system details and performance analysis. 


**Compatibility**

Privacy Plus Adblock is compatible with any Chromium-based browser. We have tested and confirmed it works with Google Chrome,  (the new) Microsoft Edge, and Brave. However, you should be able to install on other Chromium browsers. 

**Installation Instructions**

This extension is not currently on the Chrome Web Store - it must be installed using developer mode. Please visit your browser's extensions menu (chrome://extensions/ for Google Chrome, edge://extensions/ for Edge, and brave://extensions/ for Brave) and enable the "Developer Mode" toggle. Download a copy of the Privacy Plus Adblock repository, and extract it somewhere. Finally, select "Load unpacked" in your browser's extensions menu, and select your unzipped copy of the Privacy Plus Adblock repository. Privacy Plus Adblock is now installed and ready to protect your privacy!

**Usage Instructions**

There are two options in the extension menu: a toggle for the adblocker, and a toggle for the data masker. By default, the adblocker is enabled, and the data masker is disabled. 

The adblocker works for any website, while the data masker works for sites with input fields.
